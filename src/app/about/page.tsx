            As an artist, you sign up and share one post per month. Musehabit
            isn&apos;t about showcasing polished masterpieces â€“ it&apos;s a
            place to share works in progress, experiments, and explore ideas in
            their raw form. Try something that would interest you, and you
            alone. Challenge others with your unique perspective. Follow your
            muse.

              Musehabit is a unique social platform in that users can only post
              once per month. This helps all users have an equal chance to be
              seen and heard. It also encourages users to be more thoughtful
              about what they share. What represents where you are as an artist
              this month?
            </p>
            <p>
              It also harkens back to a time when the internet was more about
              staying connected with your friends and artistic peers than
              curated content.

              In addition to only being able to post once per month, Musehabit
              offers an optional &quot;accountability&quot; feature. This
              feature allows you to set a goal of creating and sharing something
              once per month.
            </p>
            <p>
              Upon signing up, you&apos;ll have until the same date next month
              to post. If you miss the deadline, Musehabit will automatically
              post for you. Your feed will replace what would have been your
              post with a customizable automated message, gently reminding you
              that you missed your deadline. It&apos;s a playful way to keep
              yourself accountable.
            </p>
            <p>
              This feature is entirely optional and can be turned off at any
              time. Its purpose is not to shame or guilt anyone but to assist
              users who wish to stay on track with their creative goals.

        <p>
          Musehabit was a passion project I started in 2014 and ran for almost a
          year. It was audio only and had around 20 participants. I started it
          because I had already felt social media was failing at helping me keep
          up with my friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          More than that, I found that surrounding myself with art was inspiring
          and made me want to create. I envisioned a platform that would
          constantly remind me that it&apos;s okay to share incomplete ideas. Or
          things that aren&apos;t perfect. For the most part I feel it was a
          success, but 2014 was a different time for the internet and me than
          2024.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ten years later, I have more knowledge of creating on the web, and I
          think even more we need a place to express ourselves that embraces
          distortion, noise, tangents, and all manner of things that do not fit
          in a neat package.
        </p>
        <p>I hope you enjoy your time here.</p>
