            Musehabit is an online open-mic platform for artists of multiple
            disciplines to share their work and connect with other creatives. We
            want to capture the essence and community feeling of an open-mic

            As an artist, you sign up and share one post per month. Musehabit
            isn&apos;t about showcasing polished masterpieces â€“ it&apos;s a
            place to share works in progress, experiments, and explore ideas in
            their raw form. Try something that would interest you, and you
            alone. Challenge others with your unique perspective. Follow your
            muse.

              Musehabit is a unique social platform in that users can only post
              once per month. This helps all users have an equal chance to be
              seen and heard. It also encourages users to be more thoughtful
              about what they share. What represents where you are as an artist
              this month?
            </p>
            <p>
              It also harkens back to a time when the internet was more about
              staying connected with your friends and artistic peers than
              curated content.

              In addition to only being able to post once per month, Musehabit
              offers an optional &quot;accountability&quot; feature. This
              feature allows you to set a goal of creating and sharing something
              once per month.

        <p>
          Musehabit was a passion project I started in 2014 and ran for almost a
          year. It was audio only and had around 20 participants. I started it
          because I had already felt social media was failing at helping me keep
          up with my friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          More than that, I found that surrounding myself with art was inspiring
          and made me want to create. I envisioned a platform that would
          constantly remind me that it&apos;s okay to share incomplete ideas. Or
          things that aren&apos;t perfect. For the most part I feel it was a
          success, but 2014 was a different time for the internet and me than
          2024.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ten years later, I have more knowledge of creating on the web, and I
          think even more we need a place to express ourselves that embraces
          distortion, noise, tangents, and all manner of things that do not fit
          in a nice neat package.
        </p>
        <p>I hope you enjoy your time here.</p>
